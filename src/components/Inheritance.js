          <p className='text-black '>"Inheritance: Book One of Two" sweeps you into a breathtaking 
          epic fantasy world where destinies entwine and secrets lie in every shadow. Lessis, a brilliant 
          mind of the empire, finds himself unjustly accused of dark and perilous research. With no other 
          choice, he flees, unknowingly setting in motion a chain of events that will shape the fate of the 
          realm.

            But it is when he crosses paths with Alenia that the true magnitude of his powers is revealed. 
            With a single touch, he glimpses the astonishing potential and strength that reside within her. 
            Devoting his remaining days to her training, Lessis imparts his knowledge and wisdom, preparing 
            Alenia for a destiny she could never have imagined.

            However, tragedy strikes with Lessis's untimely death at the hands of a Deviant, those consumed 
            by uncontrollable powers. Separated from her brother, Alenia's journey leads her to the empire's
             capital in search of a new home and answers. As her powers grow and she draws closer to 
             unlocking her true potential, she becomes a coveted prize for those who once forced Lessis 
             into exile.

            Deviant attacks plague the empire, and whispers in the wind hint at a powerful leader behind 
            these dark forcesâ€”an enigma from Alenia's past. To restore balance and peace to the realm, 
            Alenia must harness the inherited powers within her, embarking on a quest that will reveal 
            the depths of her strength and the shocking truths concealed within her bloodline.</p>
